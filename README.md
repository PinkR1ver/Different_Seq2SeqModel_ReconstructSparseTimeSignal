# Experiment on different Seq2Seq Model reconstructing sparse time signal
## Step 1. Simulate Sparse time signal
## Step 2. Sample simulating time signal get input seq
## Step 3. Get key parameters about sparse time signal  as output seq 
## Step 4. Use the input seq and output seq as the train data to train different Seq2Seq model
## Step 5. Assess different model performance
